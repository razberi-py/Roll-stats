# Interactive Simulation Suite


## Description

The **Interactive Simulation Suite** is a Python-based terminal application that allows users to perform various statistical simulations. Featuring dice rolling, coin flipping, and random walk simulations, this tool provides real-time analytics and visualizations directly in your terminal using ASCII art and color-coded outputs.

## Features

- **Dice Rolling Simulator**
  - Customize the number of rolls and dice sides.
  - View statistics like average, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
  - Visualize frequency distribution with histograms.

- **Coin Flip Simulator**
  - Specify the number of coin flips.
  - Analyze outcomes with counts, percentages, longest streaks, and probability comparisons.

- **Random Walk Simulator**
  - Set the number of steps for a one-dimensional random walk.
  - Examine metrics such as final position, total displacement, and average distance from the origin.
  - Step-by-step position visualization.

- **User-Friendly Interface**
  - Navigate through simulations using keyboard inputs.
  - Enjoy a visually appealing experience with ASCII art and color highlights.
  - Robust input validation and error handling.
